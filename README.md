# Medical Image Analysis and Classification
Bild a deep learning based system that will allow to classify medical images (DermaMNIST and RetinaMNIST data). 

a)	Load the data from the MedMNIST2D dataset for skin and retina only at the link below and verify no records are missing

b)	We have a medical image analysis and classification problem, so the data needs to be normalised and formatted considering that they are multidimensional.

c)	Visualise a subset of the data and the ground truth

d)	The data needs to be further pre-processed. We have the option to perform data augmentation aiming to improve the overall performance.

e)	Split the data to training and testing sets and consider that you can solve the problem as a classification. Consider the classes for each of the datasets and based
on your approach the data needs to be separated to training and testing appropriately TIP: consider the issue that we may have unbalanced data

f)	Build and train a few deep learning models with Keras.

g)	Evaluate the performance of the models on the test dataset and report the results in a comparative study (example metrics: F1, precision, recall, accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.)

h)	Build a website or mobile app that will allow the user to upload or capture an image with the camera and using REST API to send the data to a server (e.g. localhost or a free ones such as Heroku), execute the best deep model, and return to the app the outcome visualising the class of the uploaded data/image.

i)	Link to the dataset https://medmnist.com/
